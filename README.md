# Project 1
For this project, you will design and implement data structures that store general hotel information and reviews, and support efficient search. You will also provide a basic command line interface to query this data. The data is in JSON files that were obtained from the Expedia API.  Your will practice using the following:
-	Working with JSON files and GSON library
-	Using nested data structures from the Collection framework for efficient search. Implementing Inverted Index.
-	Object-oriented design 

You are required to use the provided starter code (including directory structure and input files) and IntelliJ IDEA for this project; do not modify the directory structure and input files.  You will need to add more classes and methods. Do not place all of your code in the main method of the HotelSearch class; this would be a poor design. Your code will be evaluated based on the functionality, efficiency and design.
Please see the description of the project and the link to the starter code on Canvas.
